Documentation
=============
Real Documentation coming soon. For now, see our recently made [HTML5 SDK Introduction Slides.](http://blog.playbrassmonkey.com/2012/01/18/introducing-the-brass-monkey-html5-sdk/ "HTML5 SDK Introduction Slides").

Also checkout the demos for some example code.

Running the demos locally
=============

* Get the SDK as mentioned above.
* Go into the SDK folder.
* Open index.html in your browser.


Spaceport Demos
-------------

Some of the demos require running their own servers because they ajax in content dynamically which is not allowed when opening a local file in a browser rather than hosting it. 

We provide a simple Python server to host the brassmonkeyjs folder.

    ./start-server
    Then open http://localhost:8181/
    Select demos from there. 
    (Don't forget to download "Brass Monkey" from the App Store for remote controlling.)
